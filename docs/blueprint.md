## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep Indigo (#3F51B5) to convey professionalism and trustworthiness. The tone evokes stability and reliability, important in event management.
- Background color: Light Gray (#F0F2F5), a very desaturated version of the primary, provides a clean and professional backdrop.
- Accent color: Teal (#009688) draws attention to calls to action without overpowering the design.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif font known for its modern, machined, objective, and neutral look; effective in both headlines and body text.
- Use clean, modern icons from a consistent set (e.g., Material Design Icons) to represent different event types and actions.
- Employ a grid-based layout for a structured and responsive design, ensuring content is well-organized and easy to navigate.
- Incorporate subtle transitions and animations to provide visual feedback and enhance user experience.
